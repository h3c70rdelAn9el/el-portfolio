                            Hello! üëãüèΩ I am a self-taught web developer who
                            transitioned from a career in music and guitar
                            instruction to the field of web development, with
                            the help and support of our awesome community.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I had a passion for music üéµ and teaching, and spent
                            many years as a guitar instructor. As my experience
                            in the music industry progressed, I started to feel
                            constrained by the available opportunities, and I
                            began to seek out a career path that would offer
                            ongoing opportunities for learning, personal growth,
                            and financial stability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I discovered web development, which captivated me
                            with its boundless potential and opportunities for
                            growth and learning. I decided to change my career
                            path and pursue self-education through the resources
                            and support of the community to learn web
                            development. I started with WordPress and then moved
                            on to more challenging technologies such as
                            JavaScript, React, Vue, and Laravel to create more
                            complex and dynamic web applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am excited to continue to expand my skills and
                            knowledge by connecting with new people, taking on
                            challenging projects and working with a diverse
                            range of clients in my journey as a coder. üñ•Ô∏è
