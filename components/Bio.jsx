                        Hello! üëãüèΩ I am a self-taught web developer who
                        transitioned from a career in music and guitar
                        instruction to the field of web development, with the
                        help and support of our awesome community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had a passion for music üéµ and teaching, and spent
                        many years as a guitar instructor. As my experience in
                        the music industry progressed, I started to feel
                        constrained by the available opportunities, and I began
                        to seek out a career path that would offer ongoing
                        opportunities for learning, personal growth, and
                        financial stability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I discovered web development, which captivated me with
                        its boundless potential and opportunities for growth and
                        learning. I decided to change my career path and pursue
                        self-education through the resources and support of the
                        community to learn web development. I started with
                        WordPress and then moved on to more challenging
                        technologies such as JavaScript, React, Vue, and Laravel
                        to create more complex and dynamic web applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am excited to continue to expand my skills and
                        knowledge by connecting with new people, taking on
                        challenging projects and working with a diverse range of
                        clients in my journey as a coder. üñ•Ô∏è
